Q24. Write a program to find whether the given integer Array arr[10] is sorted in ascending order or descending order or is not in order. The program will print  “A” for ascending, “D” for descending and “N” for no order.
Q25. Write a program in C++ which accepts an n size array and program will exchanges the value of first half elements with the second half side elements of the array.
Example : if the array is 8,10,1,3,17,90,13,60 then rearrange the array as 17,90,13,60,8,10,1,3
Q26. Write a program in C++ which accepts and integer array , program will exchanges the values at alternate locations. Eg : if the array is 8,10,1,3,17,90,13,60 then rearrange the array as 10,8,3,1,90,17,60,13
Q27. Write a program in C++ which accepts an integer array and its size program will  reverse the contents of the array without using any second array.
Q28. Write a program in C++ which accepts an integer array and its size as program will assigns the elements into a two dimensional array of integers.
Q29. Suppose A, B, C are arrays of integers of size M, N and M+N respectively. The numbers in array A appear in ascending order and B appear in descending order.
Give the necessary declaration for array A, B and C in C++. Write a program in C++ to produce third array C by merging arrays A and B in ascending order.
Q30. Write a program to sort an array with the help of selection sort of n size array
Q31. Write a C++ program to merge the contents of two sorted arrays A and B into third array C. Assume that array A is sorted in descending order, array B is sorted in Ascending order, the resultant array C is required to be in descending order.
Q32. Write a C++ program to remove the duplicate occurrence of the value preset in an integer arrayFor e.g. If array initially is X[]={1,1,1,7,5,2,2,6} After removing duplicate values the array will be X{}={1,7,5,2,6}
Q33. Write C++ program to arrange all the negative and positive numbers of the from left to right. For e.g. is an array of 10 elements initially contains{4,5,6,-7,8,-2,-10,1,13,-20} then the function will rearrange them in following manner -20,-10,-7,-2,1,4,5,6,8,13.
